# Cloud Cost Analysis & Budget Planning System (AWS)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and estimating cloud infrastructure costs using
the **AWS Pricing Calculator**. The objective is to design **cost-efficient cloud
architectures** by comparing different AWS pricing models.

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- Amazon RDS
- AWS Pricing Calculator

## Project Workflow
1. Identified infrastructure requirements for a sample cloud-based application.
2. Estimated service costs using AWS Pricing Calculator.
3. Compared **On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans**.
4. Optimized resource selection to reduce overall cloud cost.
5. Generated **monthly and yearly cost estimates** for budgeting.

## Architecture
The system architecture includes:
- **EC2** for compute resources  
- **S3** for storage  
- **RDS** for database services  
- Data transfer between services

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- Selected appropriate EC2 instance types based on workload.
- Used cost-effective storage options for S3.
- Evaluated long-term pricing models for reduced cost.

## Outcome
This project provided hands-on experience in **cloud cost estimation, budget
planning, and optimization strategies** using AWS services.
